Homework. Algebra of logic. Set theory. Graph theory
Hey there! Homework champion! ðŸ˜‰

You've already done a huge job: evaluated your satisfaction with your own life and made decisions about rapid changes in your life using matrices and vectors. Now it's time to move to the next level and plan the project of changes on your way to your new life.

So, today you will:

practice planning the types of work, their timing, and results to achieve your project goal
learn to specify a weighted graph with utilizing an adjacency matrix
learn to determine the critical path and take into account the duration of works for effective planning and control of your project
Homework description

Before doing the homework, read the notes on the topic "Algebra of Logic. Set Theory. Graph Theory."

Now you understand that changes are needed in your life. They can be effectively implemented as a project, for example: improve English, finish learning technical elements, submit resumes, attend interviews, etc. Or perhaps, you decided to develop as a project manager in a technological projectâ€¦

In any case, you need to master the methodology of project management and calculate project deadlines on a graph using the Critical Path Method (CPM). Its essence is in determining the works, which, if delayed, affect the delivery of the entire project. In project management, this helps to identify the most critical moments in the project and make timely decisions to successfully complete the project within the specified time.

As a result, you will build the shortest path to achieving your goal ðŸ˜‰

You can choose the complexity level of the task.
